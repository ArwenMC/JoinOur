# JoinOur
Tired of posting your discord, website, twitter link whenever someone asks?  
This plugin solves that problem! Always having players ask "Where can I join our Discord?", this plugin will do that for you.
**This plugin requires Spigot due to ChatClickEvents**

## Features
- Enable and Disable any command that you want.
- Setup custom messages and most importantly custom links.
- Free and always will be.  

## Contributing 
Thanks for checking us out! And if you would love to contribute that is even better. We use git flow, so PR will be merged into Develop where they are tested and released.
